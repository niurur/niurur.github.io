- ### **Spoof Detection Algorithm**
	- I developed a spoof detection solution for face recognition based access control system. 
   - Methods were developed to recognize spoofing attempts based on classical methods and trained datasets. The developed method can differentiate a real face and a face on a digital display.
   - This system was integrated with existing monocular surveillance cameras to enable contactless access control during Covid-19.
   - **Domains**: *Computer vision*, *Machine learning*, *Python*.
