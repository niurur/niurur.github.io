## Project Highlights
Following are some interesting projects I've worked on that have immensely helped me gain hands-on experience in research, computer vision, control systems, and programming. 


- ### **Vision-Based Technical Drawing Analyzing Software (Hauptberechnung - Software für Bearbeitungsberechnungen)**
	- I developed a prototype software for the manufacturing industry in Germany that analyzes specific sections of technical drawings and automatically extracts content using computer vision algorithms.
   - This software is intended to use for the time and cost estimation for the production.
   - Software consist of 4 modes [Halbautonomer Modus, Automatischer Modus, Tabellenmodus,Taschenrechner-Modus]
   - **Domains**: *Computer vision*, *Python*, *Machine learning*.

- ### **Spoof Detection Algorithm**
	- A spoof detection solution for existing face recognition based access control system.
Developed a method to recognize spoofing attempts based on classical methods and trained
datasets. The developed method can differentiate a real face and a face on a digital display.
   - This integrated with existing monocular surveillance cameras to enable contactless door unlocking during Covid-19.
   - **Domains**: *Computer vision*, *Python*.

- ### **Monocular Vision-Based Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm and Networking Infrastructure for Controlling Remote Mobile Robots**
	- Development of a vision-based monocular obstacle-avoidance algorithm for mobile robots. A prototype was built, and the algorithm was tested, incorporating optical flow and edge-based obstacle avoidance methods.
	- Creation of an infrastructure for remotely controlling mobile robots by processing data with minimal onboard hardware. Developed in conjunction with the monocular obstacle-avoiding project
   - **Domains**: *Control systems*, *Robotics*, *Computer vision*, *Embedded electronics*.
